# NextJs Sample Blog
The goal of this Project is to learn the basics of the NextJs framework.

* Static generation 
* Pre-Rendering and Data Fetching

## Pre-Rendering and Data Fetching 
Nextjs Supports Static generation with data fetching out of the box. This is achieved by using the getStaticProps method. It lets NextJs know that a page has dependencies that need to be resolved before being pre-rendered.
